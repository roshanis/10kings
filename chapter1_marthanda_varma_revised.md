# Chapter 1: Tiger of Travancore
## Marthanda Varma - The King Who Crushed Dutch Power on the Malabar Coast (1729-1758)

*From the war chronicles of Bhimrao Holkar, Maratha warrior, survivor of Portuguese dungeons, witness to the revolution that saved a kingdom*

---

The first time my horse's hooves smashed into a Dutch infantry line at Colachel, the sand leapt beneath us as if the earth itself had flinched.

The Dutch had formed as they always did when facing "native" troops: tight ranks, bayonets fixed, muskets braced to vomit lead into anyone foolish enough to charge. Near Goa I had watched European infantry in such formations chew up poorly handled cavalry until the ground was carpeted with horses. On those days we had been the ones dying in heaps before the guns.

This time, the horses were mine.

Marthanda Varma had already hired a regiment of horse from the Nawab of Arcot, men who could ride hard but had never broken a disciplined European line. I was the extra piece he bought for that board, a Maratha cavalry officer grafted onto Arcot's mercenaries to turn speed into a weapon instead of a death wish.

For weeks I drilled Arcot's men and Travancore Nair horsemen together in the Deccan style, teaching them to swarm and vanish, to feint and scatter, to reform on a shouted word or a lifted spear. We practised the long circling runs that kept us just beyond the first volley, the sharp turns that brought us in only when the enemy was already thinking about something else. The king never called me into his deepest councils, but when I spoke of horses and how to kill men with guns, he listened. That was enough.

On the morning of Colachel, the sea lay sullen and grey, Dutch ships at anchor like crouching beasts beyond the surf. Marakayar seafarers had already slipped out in the night to cut their supply craft adrift. Along the tree line, Travancore musketeers lay hidden in scooped-out pits, barrels resting on branches and bundled foliage. My mixed contingent of Arcot mercenaries, Nair horsemen, and a handful of my own Maratha veterans lay behind a low rise of sand, horses sweating under canvas screens, bits champed raw with impatience.

We heard the Dutch before we saw them: the barked commands in their guttural tongue, the clank of metal on wood, the steady tramp of boots as they marched inland from their ships. They were confident. Wet sand and scrub should have kept serious cavalry far from their muskets.

Then came the volley, a flat, ripping crack as disciplined fire tore into the killing ground the king had marked on his maps. Men went down in that first storm of lead, but not ours. When the Dutch line began to dress forward, closing the gaps in their ranks, the signal flare hissed skyward from the coconut grove, a streak of green against the low clouds.

"Now," I told my men.

We came over the rise at full gallop, hooves pounding, lances levelled. The Dutch formation had been built to repel a frontal charge across open ground, not a flanking strike from riders who knew exactly how far a horse could run in wet sand before its stride broke. Their line shuddered under the impact. Bayonets dipped. Muskets fell. Men went down beneath iron-shod hooves and the curved talwars of Tamil steel.

They had landed to teach another Indian kingdom the price of defiance. Instead, they learned how it felt to be on the wrong end of European drill wielded by men who had studied their manuals more carefully than they had themselves.

Months earlier, I had washed up on this coast half-dead, another piece of wreckage from Portuguese cruelty. My body still carried the marks of Goa's interrogation chambers: fingernails torn out, joints twisted, skin branded by heated iron. I escaped their slave ship during a storm off Malabar, clinging to a splintered spar while my fellow Maratha prisoners drowned in chains.

Fishermen had dragged me from the surf and, seeing the scars on my arms and the calluses of a cavalryman on my hands, sent word up the chain of command. Travancore was already sharpening its teeth for war. A Maratha cavalry officer who had fought Mughals and Portuguese both was too useful to ignore.

They brought me to the palace at Padmanabhapuram, not as an honored guest but as a weapon to be inspected.

Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma sat his throne like a man who had cut his own path to it through blood. Even half-conscious from fever, I recognized the type. I had seen ambitious generals, ruthless sardars, petty kings clinging to power. But this was something rarer: a ruler who had forged war and governance into a single instrument.

"You are Maratha," he said, studying me as a smith studies a new blade. "You fought Portuguese on the Konkan coast. You have led cavalry against men with guns."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"Then you will help me teach Europeans fear," he said simply. "You will show my horsemen how to break men who believe they cannot be broken."

I was not invited to the innermost councils where he and Ramayyan Dalawa traced the Dutch alliances and bought Tamil Muslim captains to their side. I stood at the edge of maps, asked questions only about distances, depths of sand, how long a horse could run after leaping from a boat into surf. I gave answers, and the king nodded, filing them away behind eyes that seemed always three moves ahead.

At Colachel, I saw those calculations unfold: Dutch guns drawn inland, powder wagons placed where one spark could turn them into chaos, Marakayar craft slicing supply lines, musketeers hidden in coconut groves, and cavalry, my cavalry, waiting to close the trap.

When the last Dutch line on the beach finally cracked beneath our hooves and their captain lowered his sword rather than die in the sand, I understood that I had just ridden in a battle that would echo from Malabar to Amsterdam.

Only then did the king send for me in full court.

The palace gates bore fresh evidence of the price of defiance: the heads of conspirators mounted on iron spikes, their eyes now feeding crows. I had seen such displays in Maratha forts, but never with such calculated precision. Each head carried a message: the merchant who had attempted poison, the priest who had blessed assassins' weapons, the courtesan who had tried treachery during intimacy.

As a veteran of countless battles, I knew the look of a kingdom at war with itself. Travancore had been that once. The man I was about to meet had spent twelve years turning it into a state where only the most useful survived. He had done what we Marathas had boasted of but never achieved: he had forced Europeans to bow.

"*Sahib*," whispered the guard assigned to escort me into the darbar, his voice carrying equal parts fear and pride, "you rode well at Colachel. But remember, here even heroes are tested. His Majesty measures every man for usefulness."

### The Court of Calculated Power

The darbar hall hummed with barely contained energy. The polished wooden floors reflected not just oil lamps but the intense focus in every courtier's eyes. Nobles moved with the careful precision of men who understood that survival required constant vigilance, their hands never straying far from concealed weapons. The air itself seemed charged with whispered secrets and watching eyes.

"The Ettuveetil Pillamar," my guide explained quietly. "The eight great families who once ruled this land like independent princes. His Majesty has broken their power. Some through negotiation. Others through the headsman's blade. The rest learned from watching."

I watched a young nobleman approach the throne with carefully measured steps. His hands trembled slightly. Fresh scars marked his wrists where shackles had bitten deep. This court had taught him new lessons in humility.

I had already stood before this man once, half-conscious and stinking of salt, dragged in from the surf as a piece of wreckage to be evaluated. This was different. Now I saw not the hard-eyed ruler who had weighed a ruined cavalryman but the full theatre of kingship, the architect of Travancore's transformation revealed as his court was meant to see him.

Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma occupied his throne with the settled assurance of a man whose right to rule had been proved in blood. The same sharp intelligence I had glimpsed on that first, fever-blurred day now burned cold and clear, his gaze sweeping the hall with the confidence of one who knew every rival had already been measured and found wanting.

His hands still bore the calluses of a warrior who practiced daily with real weapons. Yet when he thought no one was watching, I saw the faintest tremor, the only sign of sleepless nights and constant vigilance. The golden armlets on his biceps were engraved with battle scenes, not decorative filigree but records of victories he had won with his own sword. The dark stains on the wooden floor near his throne had been scrubbed but deliberately left visible, a reminder that even in this hall, blood had been spilled.

I had also seen Portuguese slave markets, watched Dutch merchants calculate profit from human cargo. Cruelty wore many faces. This one, at least, seemed to serve something beyond mere greed.

"The Maratha warrior," he said, his voice carrying the quiet authority of command. "I know what you are, soldier. I can see the tortures of Goa written on your flesh. I have read reports of your people along the Konkan and in the Deccan. Tell me, when your horse hit their line at Colachel, did you feel the moment they understood they could lose?"

My scars ached at the memory: the beach, the Dutch line buckling, their captain lowering his sword, ships pulling back with their dead still on the sand.

"Your Majesty," I said, my throat suddenly dry, "I saw Europeans break here in a way I have never seen before. And I know their captain now wears your colors."

His smile was like the edge of a freshly honed blade. "He does. Stories grow in the telling, warrior. I prefer you hear the truth from the man himself. Captain De Lannoy found our methods instructive. He learned to appreciate the compelling nature of our cause. Would you care to meet him?"

The way he spoke of instruction made my battle-hardened blood quicken. I had survived the dungeons of Goa. But there was something in this king's tone that suggested he had found methods that broke men without breaking their usefulness.

### The Transformed Captain

In a chamber adjacent to the throne room, I met Captain Eustachius De Lannoy. Not in chains, but wearing the colors of Travancore's army, a sword at his hip that no prisoner would carry.

The Dutchman still stood like a European officer, spine straight, shoulders back. But something had changed in his eyes. I had seen broken men before; they moved like ghosts, hollow and obedient. De Lannoy moved like a soldier who had found a better commander.

"*Mijn heer*," he greeted me in Dutch, letting an interpreter render the words into Malayalam before he addressed me directly in careful, Marathi-tinted Malayalam. "The king wishes us to coordinate our work. He handles the kingdom. I handle his European enemies." His glance flicked to my sword-belt. "You handle his horses."

It was not an insult and not quite praise. Just an assessment.

"Your line at Colachel held longer than I expected," I said. "Most men would have run when they saw cavalry coming in from the flank and muskets firing from the trees."

His mouth twitched. "Our infantry drilled for that. Close up, keep formation, trust the guns." He studied me in turn. "Your charge came later than I expected. You waited for the powder wagons to be exposed. That is not how 'irregulars' usually fight."

I shrugged. "On the Deccan plains, if you hit too early, you die in piles under steady muskets. You wait until their line is thinking about something else."

He nodded once. "Then perhaps we both misjudged each other. I thought you were another local horse commander who believed courage could outrun lead. The king tells me you learned under men who studied our manuals more carefully than we did."

There was respect in his tone, and that, more than the words, stung. I had done more riding and killing at Colachel than he had, yet it was clear who the king had chosen as architect of his new army.

"His Majesty has placed overall command of fortifications and drills in my hands," De Lannoy said, matter-of-fact. "He has asked that all cavalry matters report through me. I will not pretend this pleases you."

I met his gaze. "You know your infantry and your guns. I know my horses. As long as we are killing Europeans and not each other, I can live with that."

"Good," he said. "Because whatever we were before, here we are both in the king's service. And he does not tolerate divided command."

He drew a rough map on the table with his finger. "Concealed positions here, here, and here. Overlapping fields of fire. When we advanced in formation, they cut us down like wheat. When we broke formation to find cover, their cavalry appeared on our flanks."

The Travancore forces had not fought like the irregular troops Dutch armies had crushed across Asia. These soldiers reloaded faster than Dutch veterans, maintained formation under fire, and fought with European discipline perfected by commanders who understood how to kill Europeans.

"They rose from hidden positions and came at us with our own methods," De Lannoy said quietly. "European weapons, European tactics, but better. Faster reloading. Tighter formations. And they knew the ground like we never could."

I understood then. For years before Colachel, Marthanda Varma had been recruiting European military specialists. Portuguese deserters from Cochin and Quilon served as drill instructors and gunsmiths. French engineers built his fortifications. Local Christian armorers, trained by Portuguese craftsmen, maintained his arsenal of muskets and flintlocks. He had studied European methods, then hired Europeans to teach his men how to kill Europeans.

"We tried to withdraw," De Lannoy continued. "But their cavalry controlled every escape route. They could have slaughtered us all. Instead, they let enough of us live to carry the message back: Travancore is not prey. In the end only a few dozen of us, barely two dozen European soldiers, were marched in chains to Udayagiri Fort. The rest lay dead or fled."

He met my eyes. "When I was brought before the king after the battle, I expected ransom negotiations or a prisoner exchange. Instead, I found a ruler who understood European military tactics better than most European commanders. He offered me a choice: rot in prison or build him an army that could destroy any European force that came against him."

De Lannoy's smile was thin. "It wasn't a difficult choice."

### The Network of Information and Influence

The victory at Colachel had been impressive, but as I recovered from my near-drowning and the wounds from Portuguese torture, I began to understand that Marthanda Varma's battlefield victories were only half the story. He had rebuilt the entire kingdom from its foundations.

The old feudal system, where local Nair chieftains ruled their territories like independent princes, was gone. In its place: direct rule from the throne, authority increasingly earned through demonstrated service rather than mere birth, and an intelligence network that made rebellion suicidal.

The king's chief minister, Ramayyan Dalawa, explained it to me one evening in his private study, ink-stained fingers moving across a wall of maps.

"Some nobles submitted when we showed them evidence of their treason," he said. "Others required more direct persuasion. His Majesty's spies make resistance fatal." His fingertip traced a web of lines. "The temple conspiracy of 1731. Foreign arms. Quiet promises from rival Kerala courts." He smiled without warmth. "His Majesty's men were inside it months before they struck. Dozens of arrests in a single night. The trials were public and swift."

He met my gaze. "Since then, smaller plots emerge from time to time. We crush them before they ripen. The message is simple: betray the crown, die screaming. Serve with dedication, rise according to your worth."

### The Night the Palaces Burned

The first scream reached us as a thin, strangled sound in the distance. By the time the third came, it was loud enough to cut through stone.

I was summoned to the king's private chamber near midnight, my old wounds aching in the wet heat. The corridors smelled of sandalwood, sweat, and something sharper beneath it that I would later recognise as the stench of burning teak and oil. Servants flattened themselves against the walls as I passed, their lamps throwing long, distorted shadows that turned every pillar into the silhouette of a man with a drawn blade.

Marthanda Varma stood before a great map of Travancore laid out on a low table, his fingertips stained red where he had been pressing them into ink and onto noble estates. Dark hollows beneath his eyes spoke of weeks without sleep, but his hands were steady as he moved carved markers across the map with the slow precision of a man closing a trap he had envisioned for years.

Ramayyan Dalawa knelt beside the table, blood trickling from a split lip where someone, somewhere, had objected to the night's work a little too loudly.

"Your Majesty," the minister whispered, "the evidence against the Kazhakoottam lord is still circumstantial. A few letters. Rumours. Perhaps we could wait for more proof before..."

"Perhaps nothing." The king did not raise his voice; he did not need to. "Tell me, Ramayyan, what happens to kings who wait for traitors to strike first?"

The minister's throat bobbed. "They lose their kingdoms, Your Majesty."

"Precisely."

He straightened and turned toward the western windows. Through the carved latticework we could see the horizon pulsing orange, three separate blooms of fire licking at the night sky. Ancestral homes that had stood for generations were being eaten, beam by beam, by flames stoked not by accident but by royal order.

"The Kazhakoottam estate sheltered Dutch agents," he said, his gaze fixed on the burning line of hills. "Three noble houses have been caught trading letters with Van Imhoff's alliance. Their palaces stand as monuments to treason. Tonight they teach a different lesson."

I had seen Portuguese gaolers in Goa amuse themselves by branding prisoners, had watched children sold in the slave markets of the Konkan. That had been cruelty for sport, profit, or boredom. This was something colder. Here, fire was a tool, not a pleasure. The difference did not make it easier to watch.

"Trust no one completely," he said to me, still looking at the distant fires. "Even you, Maratha. Especially you. The Europeans rule through fear dressed up as efficiency. They teach their subjects that resistance is futile, that their methods are superior to ours." He lifted a cup of bitter herbal brew, hands calm again. "Fear is simply another instrument. And I have learned to play it better than any Portuguese merchant or Dutch commander."

He flicked his fingers toward the window. "Those noble families have lost everything tonight. Their retainers will scatter. Their lands will be parcelled out to men whose loyalty has been proven in blood, not merely inherited through birth. Every lord who watches that glow from his own terrace will understand that conspiracy against the crown ends in ashes. Is this cruel? Perhaps. Is it necessary? Absolutely."

He paused, listening to another distant cry. When he spoke again, his voice was almost gentle.

"You think me cruel," he said. "You wonder how a king who builds schools can burn palaces."

Years of torture and interrogation had taught me when speech was dangerous. I kept my silence.

"I was nineteen when they tried to poison me the first time," he went on, voice dropping to a murmur. "A sweetmeat from my aunt. I fed it to a dog. The animal died screaming." His fingers traced the rim of his cup as if he could still feel the animal convulsing beneath his hand. "I was twenty-two when my uncle paid assassins to cut my throat in my sleep. They killed two of my guards before I woke and killed two of them myself."

He turned back to me then, and behind the weary paranoia I saw the cold arithmetic that had brought us all to this room.

"Every mercy I show is weighed and measured, Maratha. Every punishment serves a purpose. Those burning houses? Their lands will go to men who understand that their fortunes begin and end with the crown. The survivors will learn that lineage is nothing without absolute dedication. Every raja considering rebellion will hear of tonight and decide he loves his children more than his pride."

He smiled, a tired, broken smile, the firelight from the windows catching in his eyes.

"I do not burn noble estates because I enjoy it," he said. "I burn them because this is the exact quantity of fear required to build a kingdom that will outlive me."

The king had not stopped at military reform. During my months in Travancore, I witnessed the transformation of the kingdom's foundations.

Land seized from executed nobles was redistributed to create thousands of small landholders. State monopolies over pepper and other key exports secured the kingdom's trading wealth and broke the Dutch stranglehold on commerce, forcing merchants to buy directly from the crown. Irrigation tanks and canals spread across the countryside, raising yields. Courts administered justice according to fixed law rather than noble whim.

At Udayagiri fort, I watched Nair soldiers drill with muskets, moving in tight formation like European infantry. But when their young officer barked commands in Malayalam rather than Dutch, I understood: this was not imitation but mastery.

Twenty thousand Nair warriors, the Thiruvithamkoor Nair Pattalam, formed the backbone of his army, each man drilled in European tactics until they could match any colonial force. After Colachel, De Lannoy oversaw construction of stone forts at strategic points, each equipped with cannons cast in local foundries from captured Dutch metal. Portuguese deserters and French engineers had taught Travancore's soldiers how to kill Europeans. Now they were perfecting those lessons.

The king had established training centers and court programs where young men studied mathematics, cartography, and the practical science of war. Not to become European, but to match and exceed European capabilities.

"We are proving," he told me one evening, "that an Indian kingdom need not bow to foreign power. We simply become stronger than they are."

### Van Imhoff's Miscalculation

Two years before the battle, the Dutch Governor of Ceylon, Van Imhoff, visited Kochi and assembled an alliance of local rulers to pressure Travancore. He sent threatening messages demanding submission to Dutch terms.

The king's response became legend. He dismissed the threat with a joke. "Europe jayikkan pokanam ennu njan chinthichittundu... pakshe avideyulla kuliru kaalam enikku ishtamalla," he reportedly said – *I've thought of going to conquer Europe, but I don't care for the cold there.*

When Van Imhoff's alliance finally moved against Travancore at Colachel in 1741, they discovered they were not facing a traditional Indian kingdom but a military force designed specifically to kill Europeans.

### The Dutch Come Begging

I was present when the Dutch envoys arrived at court, their uniforms unable to conceal their awareness that they were dealing with a power that had humiliated them in battle.

"Your Majesty," the chief Dutch representative began in formal Dutch, his words carried into Malayalam by an interpreter, "the Honorable Company seeks a treaty guaranteeing Dutch trading privileges in exchange for recognition of your sovereignty."

Marthanda Varma listened, then leaned forward slightly.

"Gentlemen," he replied in halting Dutch, a language he had never revealed he knew, "let us discuss terms that reflect current circumstances."

What followed was a lesson in negotiation from strength. Within hours, the king had secured not only Dutch recognition of Travancore's independence but trading agreements that made the Dutch East India Company pay for privileges they once took by force. They would pay fees, accept Travancore oversight, and provide military cooperation if requested.

"And one final condition," the king added. "Captain De Lannoy will remain in Travancore service. His expertise has proven invaluable. I trust the Company supports this arrangement?"

The Dutch envoys had no choice but to agree. They had come seeking restoration of their former position and found themselves accepting subordinate status. The age of easy European dominance was ending, one battle at a time.

### Escape

For six months after Colachel, I remained in Travancore. The realization came slowly: I was not a guest. I was being weighed.

The king summoned me often enough to keep me close, rarely enough to remind me of distance. He asked for my opinion on cavalry deployments, on Dutch tactics, on how Marathas organized their horse. He listened, nodded, filed my answers away. But I never sat in the inner circle. I stood at the edge of the lamp light while Ramayyan, temple advisers, and coastal captains argued over maps I was not invited to touch.

De Lannoy, by contrast, seemed always to be at the king's right hand. At Udayagiri I saw him laying out new bastions while I drilled a handful of horse in the yard below. In council, his finger traced the lines of future forts while mine traced the lines of a saddle. When Dutch envoys bowed, their eyes flicked to his face, not mine. I had ridden into their ranks at Colachel; he had surrendered and been remade. Yet it was his name that ran through the court like a new title.

I would be lying if I said envy did not bite. I had done more fighting for this king than any Dutchman, but the Dutchman held the trust I thought I had earned.

One evening, after the Dutch envoys had bowed and gone and De Lannoy had returned to drilling Nair musketeers, the king kept me back.

"You have no land of your own," he said, as if reciting from a ledger. "No estate, no fort, no family to return to in the Deccan."

"Only my sword, Your Majesty."

"A poor pillow," he said dryly. Then, more softly: "Stay. I will give you a small cavalry command along our northern marches, a house on this coast where the monsoon smells of pepper instead of blood. You have seen how easily Marathas can be bought by Portuguese silver. I would rather buy one Maratha with honor."

The offer was not small. For most men, land, a command, and safety under a ruler who understood both Europeans and war would have been a lifetime's ambition. But I knew that small border command would never make me more than a useful outsider in a story already being written around De Lannoy and Ramayyan.

But when I closed my eyes, I saw not pepper fields but the black soil of the Deccan, the forts of my people, the graves of comrades who had died believing they fought for something larger than any one king.

"Your Majesty," I said carefully, "I am grateful. But I am Maratha. I was born under other banners. If I stay, I will always be a stranger in your chronicles."

His eyes narrowed, weighing the risk. "Strangers can be useful."

"Yes," I said. "Until they are not."

He studied me for a long moment, then smiled that thin, sad smile I had come to recognize. "Very well. Go north. Tell your sardars what you have seen here. Tell them Europeans can bleed and that a king in the south has already proven it."

The Tiger of Travancore never wasted anything, not even my refusal. If he could not keep my sword, he would use my tongue.

On the final night of the sixth month, when monsoon rains masked all sound, I walked out through palace courtyards where the guards somehow failed to notice a Maratha officer slipping into the dark. It felt less like an escape than a release.

As I stumbled north through fever and starvation, reaching Maratha territory weeks later, my commanders asked what I had learned in Travancore. I told them everything: the military reforms, the intelligence networks, the governance that had broken European power, the way cavalry, muskets, and sea power had been fused into a single weapon.

Had I ever been a prisoner? Or had I been a messenger all along, sent to carry the story of Travancore's revolution to every court that still believed Europeans were invincible?

If so, it was the king's most elegant stratagem: turning escape into service, making freedom itself a tool of his design.

I told myself I had chosen liberty. But as I described Marthanda Varma's methods to Maratha generals, watching them take notes and seeing recognition dawn in their faces, I understood: the Tiger had calculated my choice long before I made it.

There was no escaping a king who thought three moves ahead. I had never been free at all.

**Historical Note:** Marthanda Varma's victory over the Dutch at Colachel in 1741 is widely regarded as the first decisive defeat of a European colonial power by an Indian kingdom on Indian soil, particularly on the Malabar coast. His centralizing reforms and use of European military advisors helped give Travancore unusual autonomy even under later British paramountcy and showed that European military and administrative advantages could be matched through careful study, preparation, and disciplined execution. Anecdotal stories such as his reported jest about "invading Europe" come from later tradition and may be apocryphal, but they capture contemporary perceptions of his confidence.
