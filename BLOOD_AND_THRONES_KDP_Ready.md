## FOREWORD

For over a thousand years, the Indian subcontinent witnessed the rise and fall of extraordinary rulers whose names have been erased from popular history but whose impact shaped a civilization. While European medieval history celebrates its kings and conquerors, India's most brilliant and brutal monarchs remain largely unknown to the modern world.

*Blood and Thrones* resurrects ten of these shadow emperors—men who revolutionized warfare, created surveillance states, built naval empires, and wielded power with a combination of genius and savagery that would make Machiavelli himself take notes. These are not the sanitized tales found in textbooks, but visceral accounts of rulers who understood that ultimate power requires ultimate ruthlessness.

From the riverine battles of Assam to the economic laboratories of Delhi, from the naval innovations of Kerala to the cultural wars of Maharashtra, these kings developed technologies and strategies that influenced the subcontinent for centuries. Their stories reveal the brutal reality behind India's medieval transformation and the extraordinary individuals who shaped the destiny of hundreds of millions.

Each chapter is told through the eyes of those who witnessed these rulers firsthand—enemy generals, foreign observers, court scholars, and survivors of their reigns. These perspectives provide intimate access to personalities and events that official histories often obscure, revealing the human complexity behind political brilliance and systematic violence.

This is history as it actually happened: bloody, brilliant, and utterly captivating.
