# Author's Historical Note: Truth, Invention, and Point of View

This book is built around ten first-person witnesses observing real rulers in real crises. The kings, their eras, and the broad outcomes of their reigns are historical; the specific narrators, many conversations, and much of the interior psychology are invented to turn archival fragments into lived experience.

Below is a chapter-by-chapter guide to what is broadly grounded in the record versus what is dramatized.

## Chapter 1 – Marthanda Varma (Travancore)

- **Historical core:** The defeat of the Dutch at Colachel (1741), De Lannoy's defection and service to Travancore, Travancore's military reforms, and Marthanda Varma's consolidation of power against Nair chiefs are all attested in contemporary and later sources.
- **Fictional elements:** The Maratha narrator, detailed conversations with De Lannoy and Ramayyan Dalawa, and the specific mechanics of intelligence operations are imagined but consistent with the political and military structures of 18th‑century Travancore.

## Chapter 2 – Alauddin Khilji (Delhi Sultanate)

- **Historical core:** Alauddin's market and price controls, anti‑corruption measures in the army (Dagh and Chehra systems come to maturity later but have antecedents here), repeated Mongol invasions and defeats, the role of Zafar Khan, and Malik Kafur's southern campaigns are all well documented.
- **Fictional elements:** The Mongol convert narrator, the prison framing device, specific dialogue, and detailed battlefield sensations are invented to dramatize how those policies might have felt from inside the system.

## Chapter 3 – Lachit Borphukan (Ahom Kingdom)

- **Historical core:** The Battle of Saraighat (1671), Ahom riverine tactics, Ram Singh's command of a large Mughal force, and the strategic importance of the Brahmaputra are all grounded in Assamese chronicles and later histories.
- **Fictional elements:** João Ribeiro, the Portuguese double agent, his gold payments via hawala, and his precise acts of sabotage are fictional but reflect real patterns of European gunners, mercenary politics, and intelligence trading in 17th‑century India.

## Chapter 4 – Bukka Raya I (Vijayanagara)

- **Historical core:** Bukka's reign (1356–1377), his role (with Harihara) in founding Vijayanagara, campaigns against the Madurai Sultanate and Bahmani Sultanate, and the association with Vidyaranya are historically attested, though often through later traditions.
- **Fictional elements:** Ibrahim al‑Malabari (the Moplah narrator), the detailed Warangal‑to‑Delhi captivity narrative, their joint study of Persian administration, and the intimate language politics of the early Vijayanagara court are imaginative reconstructions used to explore how cross‑religious collaboration and later exclusion could have felt in practice.

## Chapter 5 – Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I (Pandya Empire)

- **Historical core:** Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan's expansion across coastal Andhra and Sri Lanka, his conflicts with Hoysalas and other southern powers, and the wealth and reach of the mid‑13th‑century Pandya state are established in inscriptions and chronicles.
- **Fictional elements:** The admiral‑narrator, the exact composition of fleets, specific siege narratives (e.g., Kannanur Koppam as depicted), and the proposed alliance with Balban against the Kakatiyas are invented to show what a coordinated land–sea strategist of that period might have attempted.

## Chapter 6 – Simhana II Yadava (Devagiri)

- **Historical core:** The Yadava court at Devagiri, Marathi's rise as a literary and administrative language in the 13th century, and figures like Mukundaraja and later Jnaneshwar signal a real vernacular turn in the region.
- **Fictional elements:** Vaidyanatha Shastri (the Sanskrit chronicler), the famine‑council scene, the specific decree chronology, and the inner debates about "polluting" Sanskrit by using it with commoners are dramatizations that compress and personalize a long, complex linguistic shift.

## Chapter 7 – Ghiyas ud din Balban (Delhi Sultanate)

- **Historical core:** Balban's background as a slave‑noble, his rise through the Chihalgani, the assertion of divine kingship (Zil‑i‑ilahi), the harsh suppression of the Forty, the Dagh and Chehra branding systems, and the development of a more systematic intelligence apparatus are attested in Persian chronicles.
- **Fictional elements:** Imad al‑Din Raihan (the dying spymaster), the exact inner workings of the Barid network as described, and individual cases like Vishnu Das are invented to explore the human cost of making governance "machine‑like."

## Chapter 8 – Kapilendra Deva (Gajapati Empire)

- **Historical core:** Kapilendra's usurpation of the Eastern Ganga throne, his expansion from Kalinga into the Deccan and Bengal, his large elephant corps, and multi‑front wars against Vijayanagara, Bahmani, and Bengal are supported by inscriptions and regional chronicles.
- **Fictional elements:** The Bahmani narrator, the precise numbers (five thousand elephants as a symbolic exaggeration), the Devarakonda battle details, and specific intelligence‑operation vignettes are fictionalized but built on real geopolitical pressures and military practices of 15th‑century eastern India.

## Chapter 9 – Vidyadhara Chandela (Chandela Kingdom)

- **Historical core:** Vidyadhara's resistance to Mahmud of Ghazni, the strength of Kalinjar, and the artistic and architectural achievements at Khajuraho (especially Kandariya Mahadeva) are well known. Later traditions remember Chandela resistance as a check on Ghaznavid expansion.
- **Fictional elements:** Captain Siyavash ibn Ahmad (the Persian engineer‑narrator), the detailed night‑attack machinery, and the specific siege device designs are imaginative extrapolations from real fortification and elephant warfare practices.

## Chapter 10 – Raja Bhoja Paramara (Malwa)

- **Historical core:** Bhoja's reign from Dhara, his reputation as a prolific scholar‑king, his architectural and literary patronage, and his eventual defeat by combined enemies (notably the Chalukyas) are well documented in inscriptional and textual tradition.
- **Fictional elements:** Abu Nasr al‑Utbi as a late investigator in ruined Dhara, the "three letters" conspiracy, the specific metallurgy manuscript that bleeds, and the unfinished "Mirror of the Scholar‑King" manual are narrative devices used to personify the real tension between Bhoja's intellectual ambition and his political vulnerability.

**How to Read These Narratives**

- Treat each chapter as a **historical thriller built on a factual skeleton**: dates, places, major battles, and outcomes are anchored in the record; characters' thoughts, dialogue, and some connecting events are invented to make those facts emotionally legible.
- When in doubt, the **Historical Note** and **Editor's Note** at the end of each chapter tell you where I have deviated most from consensus scholarship.
