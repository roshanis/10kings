## FRONT COVER

### Visual Concept: "The Weight of History"
**Central Image:**
A dramatic, high-contrast close-up of an ancient, weathered map of India spread across a dark wooden table. The map is not pristine; it is torn, stained with ink and blood.

**Key Elements:**
1.  **The Crown:** A heavy, ornate Indian royal crown (generic but historically plausible) sits on the map, but it is slightly tilted or cracked, suggesting the fragility of power.
2.  **The Weapons:** A curved sword (Tulwar or Khanda) and a quill pen lie crossed beneath the crown. The sword's edge glints in the light; the quill is dripping fresh ink (or blood).
3.  **Lighting:** The scene is lit by a single, unseen oil lamp from the side, creating deep *chiaroscuro* shadows. The light catches the gold of the crown and the wet ink/blood on the map.
4.  **Atmosphere:** Dust motes dancing in the light. A sense of secrets hidden in the shadows.

## BACK COVER

### Blurb
**Headline:** **HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY THE SURVIVORS. THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.**

**Body Text:**
India’s history is often told through the rise and fall of great dynasties, but the true architects of its destiny are often hidden in the shadows. 

*The Forgotten Kings* resurrects ten extraordinary rulers who defined their eras but faded from popular memory. From the naval genius who crushed a European colonial power to the slave who built an intelligence state, from the scholar-king who fought with books to the elephant lord who challenged three empires.

Told through the eyes of the spies, soldiers, and scholars who served them, these narratives strip away the myth to reveal the brutal, brilliant reality of medieval power. This is not just history; it is a chronicle of ambition, betrayal, and the terrible price of immortality.

**Visual Elements:**
*   Background: A continuation of the dark wooden texture from the front.
*   A faint, ghostly overlay of the 10 narrator portraits (eyes only) in a strip across the middle.
