# Chapter 3: The River Warrior
## Lachit Borphukan - The Ahom Naval Strategist Who Defeated the Mughals (1622-1672)

*From the campaign journal of Captain João Ribeiro, Portuguese military advisor serving with the Mughal imperial forces—and secret informant in the pay of Lachit Borphukan*

*[Editor's Note: While João Ribeiro is a fictional character, Portuguese military experts called "firangis" served as gunners and naval specialists with Mughal forces during the Ahom-Mughal conflicts. Mercenary betrayal and intelligence trading were common practices among European military adventurers in 17th-century India, where shifting loyalties and gold payments often determined outcomes of strategic campaigns.]*

The Brahmaputra—or Luit, as the Ahom call her—runs differently in Assam, not like the tame rivers of Europe or even the great waterways of the Deccan, but as a living force that shapes the very nature of warfare itself. The Ahom people worship her as Devi Maa—the mother goddess—and they are not wrong to do so. She is temperamental and unpredictable, swelling with monsoon fury one month and revealing treacherous sandbars the next. Her channels shift with the seasons, her currents hide dangers that no outsider can anticipate, and her moods can make or break armies that dare to cross her waters.

Lachit Borphukan had grown up on this river. He knew her temper the way a son knows his mother's moods—instinctively, intimately, with the kind of understanding that cannot be learned from maps or military manuals. The Mughals came from the central lands of India, where rivers were obstacles to be crossed or resources to be controlled. They did not understand that here, the Brahmaputra was not merely terrain but an ally that would fight beside the Ahom if properly respected.

As a Portuguese firangi serving with the Mughal imperial forces under Ram Singh I, I had witnessed the fall of kingdoms across India to Mughal artillery and organization. When we approached Assam in 1670, I expected to find another regional power preparing for inevitable submission to Aurangzeb's imperial machine.

Instead, I discovered something far more profitable: a kingdom whose commander understood that European mercenaries like me could be bought, and whose gold was worth more than any loyalty I might pretend to feel toward the Mughals. The river would become my fortune, and Lachit Borphukan would be the paymaster who made it happen.

But first, I had to help him win.

### The Battle of Saraighat

Blood and splinters fill the air as the first Ahom boats crash into our line. I watch from the deck of our war galley as their tactics—tactics I helped design—shatter our careful formations. Small, swift vessels ram directly into the hulls of our ships, their crews leaping aboard with curved swords flashing in the morning sun.

I feel nothing. Not guilt. Not satisfaction. Just the cold calculation of a man who knows he has bet on the winning side.

"*Madre de Deus!*" I scream for effect as an Ahom warrior lands beside me, his blade opening the throat of our gunner before the man can even reach for his cutlass. I raise my pistol, fire wildly into the smoke—careful to hit nothing—and stumble backward as if driven by fear. The deck becomes slippery with blood as bodies fall around our cannon.

This is the culmination of six months of careful treachery, and it is going exactly as planned.

Let me be clear about what I am. I am a mercenary, a firangi who has served Portuguese interests, Dutch interests, Maratha interests, and now Mughal interests—whoever pays the best rate for European gunnery expertise. Loyalty is a luxury for men who own land and titles. For men like me, who live by skill and wit, loyalty is simply another commodity to be sold to the highest bidder.

I became a traitor not through careful seduction, but through capture and pragmatic calculation.

Six months before the battle of Saraighat, Ram Singh sent me on a reconnaissance mission upriver from our forward positions. My task was straightforward: survey Ahom defensive installations along the Brahmaputra, assess their artillery capabilities, identify weak points for future assault. I took two Mughal soldiers as escorts and a local guide who claimed to know safe routes through Ahom territory.

The guide, of course, worked for Lachit.

We were three miles into Ahom-controlled waters when the ambush came. Boats emerged from reed channels on both sides—not the crude fishing vessels I'd expected, but armed patrol craft moving with coordinated precision. My escorts died quickly, arrows through their throats before they could raise their muskets. I survived only because I threw my weapons into the water and raised my hands in immediate surrender.

They bound me, blindfolded me, and transported me upriver for what felt like hours. When the blindfold came off, I stood in a riverside warehouse that smelled of fish and hemp, facing the Ahom commander whose name was spoken with reverence throughout Assam.

I expected interrogation, perhaps torture, certainly imprisonment. Instead, Lachit Borphukan offered me gold.

I have learned one truth in two decades of warfare from Goa to the Ganges: empires rise and empires fall, but gold remains gold.

### The Conversion

Standing before Lachit Borphukan as a bound prisoner, I calculated my options quickly. They were limited. I could refuse to cooperate and likely face execution. I could provide false information and definitely face execution when discovered. Or I could listen to what this man wanted and assess whether survival lay in that direction.

Lachit Borphukan at forty-nine was not an impressive physical specimen. Consumption had wasted his frame, and he coughed frequently into a cloth that he tried to hide from view. But his eyes held the sharp intelligence of a man who understood that warfare was mathematics—calculations of force, position, and timing that could be optimized with sufficient information.

"Captain Ribeiro," he said in surprisingly good Portuguese. "You were sent to scout my defenses. To identify weaknesses. To provide Ram Singh with intelligence that would help him conquer my kingdom."

I said nothing. What was there to say?

"I could execute you as a spy," he continued. "Your two escorts are already dead. Ram Singh knows you were on reconnaissance. If you simply disappear, he will assume you were captured and killed. There will be no ransom demand, no prisoner exchange, no diplomatic complications."

He paused, coughed briefly into his cloth.

"Or," he said, opening a chest that sat beside his chair, "I could send you back."

The chest was filled with gold mohurs. More gold than I had seen in five years of mercenary service.

"You will return to Ram Singh and report that you escaped after your escorts were killed. You will continue your role as Portuguese military advisor, providing expertise on naval tactics and artillery placement. But you will also provide me with every significant piece of intelligence about Mughal strategy, troop movements, and tactical planning."

He gestured to the gold.

"Half now. Hidden for you in Dhaka where Ram Singh cannot confiscate it. The other half upon Mughal defeat—which, with your help, becomes significantly more likely."

I stared at the gold, then at this dying man who held my life in his hands.

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you die tonight, and I find another way to gather intelligence. Less efficient, but still possible." He leaned forward. "But you won't refuse, Captain. Because you're a mercenary, not a patriot. You serve whoever pays best. And I'm offering to pay you far more than Ram Singh ever could."

He was right. I was a mercenary. The Mughals paid me for my gunnery expertise, but I held no loyalty to Aurangzeb or his empire. I was Portuguese, not Mughal. My allegiance was to gold, not to flags.

"How do I know you'll actually pay?" I asked. "Half the gold means nothing if you betray me after I provide intelligence."

"A fair concern." He gestured to one of his officers. "Show him."

They brought forward the merchant I'd seen selling betel nut at our Mughal camp three times in the past month. Ramcharan, the traders called him.

"Your contact," Lachit explained. "He visits your camp weekly under cover of commerce. You will pass intelligence to him. Every piece of accurate information you provide will be confirmed through my other sources. If it proves true and useful, payment will be delivered. If you provide false intelligence, you will be killed. If you reveal our arrangement to Ram Singh, your gold in Dhaka will disappear and you will be killed."

He coughed again, wiped blood from his lips.

"I'm not asking you to betray your country, Captain. Portugal has no stake in this war. I'm asking you to make a pragmatic business decision: continue serving the Mughals for ordinary wages, or serve both sides for extraordinary profit."

I appreciated his directness. We were both professionals engaged in a business transaction. He needed what I could provide, and I needed to survive—and profit from that survival.

"How do I know you can actually win?" I asked, calculating the risk. Betraying the Mughals to a losing side would leave me with nothing but a death sentence if discovered. "Ram Singh commands 30,000 infantry, 18,000 cavalry, 40 warships, and 21 Rajput chiefs with their contingents. These are not forces that can be defeated through river tactics alone."

For the first time, something like doubt flickered across his face. He coughed, harder this time, and flecks of blood stained the cloth.

"You think I'm confident?" His voice was harsh. "I'm dying, *firangi*. This consumption will kill me within a year, perhaps less. The Mughals have sent the largest army Assam has ever faced. Thirty thousand professional soldiers against my fifteen thousand. Their artillery reduces fortresses that have stood for centuries. Their cavalry has crushed kingdoms from Delhi to Bengal."

He stood, began pacing despite the obvious pain it caused him.

"Yes, I know the river. Yes, I've prepared defenses. Yes, my people worship the Brahmaputra as Devi Maa and she will fight beside us. But do you know what keeps me awake at night?" He turned to face me, and I saw the exhaustion beneath his determination. "The knowledge that if Ram Singh is slightly better than I calculated, if his artillery finds the right positions, if his Rajput chiefs coordinate their attacks more effectively than I've predicted—then everything I've built will be ashes, and Assam will become just another Mughal province."

He crossed to the chest of gold, opened it so I could see the fortune inside.

"I'm not buying you because I'm confident. I'm buying you because I'm desperate. The river is necessary but not sufficient. My tactics are sound but not guaranteed. I need every advantage, every scrap of intelligence, every edge I can purchase with gold. Because if I lose, my kingdom falls. And I will not let my kingdom fall."

He wiped blood from his lips.

"So here is the truth, Portuguese: I believe I can win. I have studied the Mughals for twenty years, prepared for this moment my entire life, built defenses that exploit every advantage this valley offers. But belief is not certainty. That's why I need to know exactly what Ram Singh is planning, exactly where he'll position his forces, exactly when he'll strike. Your intelligence won't guarantee my victory—but without it, I face defeat."

He gestured to the chest again.

"This is not the gold of a confident king. This is the gold of a desperate commander who knows he faces the greatest military machine in Asia, and who is willing to do whatever it takes—including bribing mercenaries—to protect his people."

I studied him, this dying man preparing to face an empire. And I realized something: his desperation made him more trustworthy, not less. A confident man might betray an informant once victory was secure. A desperate man would pay every coin promised because he needed to keep his sources reliable for the next crisis.

"Show me your plans," I said.

He led me to a room where maps covered every surface. Not the crude sketches that passed for military planning in most Indian kingdoms, but detailed charts showing every channel, sandbar, and seasonal variation of the Brahmaputra across hundreds of miles. Positions were marked in multiple colors indicating different types of defensive installations. Supply routes were traced through waterways that did not appear on any Mughal map.

"The river gives me advantages," Lachit explained, his finger tracing defensive positions around Saraighat. "But advantages are not victory. The Mughals see it as an obstacle to overcome. If I know exactly when, where, and how they will attempt to cross, I can turn those advantages into traps. Your information will let me position forces with perfect precision, forcing Ram Singh to fight under conditions where all his strengths become weaknesses."

I studied the maps, seeing the sophisticated defensive system he had constructed. The narrow width of the Brahmaputra at Saraighat created ideal conditions for the small-boat tactics he had developed. His fortifications controlled every approach while remaining supplied through waterways the Mughals could not interdict.

It was brilliant. It might work.

"You have a chance," I said finally, careful not to promise certainty. A man does not construct this level of preparation unless he understands how slim that chance is.

"A chance is enough," Lachit said quietly. "Combined with your intelligence, preparation, and the river's favor—it might be enough."

He looked at me with those exhausted, calculating eyes.

"I'm dying. I'm facing the greatest empire in the world. I'm asking you to commit treason for gold. But I'm not asking you to believe in my cause or my gods or my people. I'm asking you to make a pragmatic bet: that desperation combined with intelligence and home advantage can defeat confidence and overwhelming force."

He extended his hand.

"Will you take that bet?"

I looked at the gold, at the maps, at this dying man who was gambling his kingdom on river knowledge and purchased intelligence.

"Yes," I said. "I'll take that bet."

He had my bonds cut. We shook hands—not as captor and prisoner, but as business partners entering a mutually profitable arrangement.

"You will be returned downstream tonight," Lachit explained. "Released near your forward positions. Your story is simple: after your escorts were killed, you hid in the reeds, then made your way back by stealing a small boat. Ram Singh will question you, but he has no reason to suspect collaboration. You are, after all, Portuguese—captured and released by people who have no quarrel with Portugal."

He paused, studying me with those calculating eyes.

"Your first intelligence report should come within a week. Details of Mughal artillery positions and Ram Singh's assessment of our defenses. Ramcharan will collect it during his next visit to your camp."

They blindfolded me again, transported me downriver in darkness, and released me on a muddy bank three miles from our forward positions. I stumbled into camp at dawn, soaked and exhausted, spinning my story of escape and survival.

Ram Singh believed me. Why wouldn't he? I was his Portuguese artillery expert, not a potential traitor. The Ahom had simply failed to secure a valuable prisoner.

What he didn't know: they had secured something far more valuable. They had bought me.

That night, I retrieved the gold waiting for me in Dhaka, delivered exactly as promised. I buried it beneath the floorboards of my rented house and became a traitor to the Mughal cause.

### The Geography of Betrayal

Over the following months, I provided Lachit with a complete intelligence picture of Mughal capabilities and intentions. Every strategic discussion I attended with Ram Singh became material for my secret reports. Every tactical debate among our officers was memorized and passed to Ramcharan during our weekly meetings behind the supply tents, where he continued to visit camp under the cover of his betel nut trade.

The arrangement worked flawlessly. Ram Singh never suspected his Portuguese artillery advisor. Why would he? I had "escaped" from Ahom captivity and returned with useful observations about their defensive positions. I continued to provide competent advice on naval tactics and gun placements. My loyalty seemed unquestionable.

The Ahom intelligence system was more sophisticated than anything I had encountered in my years of service. Messages were carried by boatmen whose daily activities provided natural cover. Dead drops were maintained in fishing villages along the river. Codes were hidden in market transactions and temple offerings. It was a spider's web of information gathering that turned every civilian into a potential spy—and I was now one thread in that web.

Gold payments arrived regularly, delivered in rice flour sacks, wrapped in waxed cloth to prevent clinking. Each successful intelligence report earned more coins added to my growing fortune buried in Dhaka. Money that would wait for me when this campaign ended, regardless of which side officially won.

Though I already knew which side would win. I was ensuring it.

The information I provided was devastatingly comprehensive:

Ram Singh's assessment of Ahom military capabilities: "Every Assamese soldier is expert in rowing boats, in shooting arrows, in digging trenches and in wielding guns and cannons." This told Lachit that we understood we faced skilled opponents, which would shape our cautious tactical approach.

Details of our 4,000 elite char-hazaari mansab troops, their training, and their deployment patterns. This allowed Lachit to identify which formations posed the greatest threat and where to concentrate his defenses.

Complete intelligence on our artillery capabilities—the number, type, and positioning of our cannons, and critically, the limitations of their effectiveness on water-mounted platforms where recoil and stability became significant problems.

Information about supply lines and logistics that revealed exactly how long Ram Singh could maintain his siege positions before resource constraints would force him to either attack or withdraw.

The most valuable intelligence concerned Ram Singh's naval strategy. As a Portuguese military advisor, I was deeply involved in planning our river operations. I knew exactly how many warships we possessed, their capabilities and limitations, and the tactical doctrine that would guide their deployment.

All of this, I fed to Lachit with methodical precision.

The Ahom commander absorbed every piece of intelligence I provided, integrating it into his defensive planning with impressive analytical skill. I watched through my secret reports as he adjusted his positions, concentrated forces at critical points, and developed specific counter-tactics designed to exploit the weaknesses I had revealed.

"Your information about their artillery limitations on water platforms is particularly valuable," he told me during one of our clandestine meetings. "It confirms that if I force them to fight from boats rather than shore positions, their firepower advantage disappears."

"Their warships are larger and more heavily armed than your boats," I pointed out, playing devil's advocate to test his confidence. "Ship to ship, you are outgunned."

"Ship to ship, yes," Lachit agreed. "But I do not plan to fight ship to ship. I plan to fight with superior numbers of smaller vessels, coordinated through signals that your people will not understand, attacking from directions that do not appear on your charts, exploiting currents and depths that I know and Ram Singh does not."

He was describing an unprecedented approach to naval warfare, one that abandoned traditional line-of-battle engagements in favor of swarming tactics that overwhelmed through superior mobility and local knowledge.

"The Mughals will expect us to fight like traditional Indian naval forces," Lachit continued, his voice carrying absolute certainty. "Individual ships seeking glory through single combat. Instead, we will fight like a school of fish, moving together to overwhelm larger predators through coordinated action."

I was providing him with more than intelligence. I was giving him the ability to see through Mughal eyes, to understand not just what we would do but why we would do it. That understanding would prove decisive.

### The Arsenal of Innovation

My reports to Lachit also included detailed assessments of Ahom military capabilities that I observed during my visits to their positions—ostensibly for reconnaissance, actually to provide my paymaster with feedback on his preparations.

The weapons systems the Ahom had developed were more sophisticated than Ram Singh's intelligence had suggested. Their arsenal included five types of cannons, eleven types of matchlock guns, and 1,200 ramchangis—light field pieces that could be rapidly repositioned during battle. These weapons were mounted on small, maneuverable boats that could outfight our larger vessels through superior tactical coordination.

What impressed me most was their elite Hiloidari Konwars, a regiment of musketeer princes whose marksmanship exceeded that of most imperial troops. These aristocratic warriors combined traditional Ahom martial skills with advanced firearms training, creating a military unit that possessed both social authority and technical expertise. Their matchlocks, fired with burning cannon fuse, could deliver accurate volleys that disrupted formations while their noble status ensured absolute loyalty to Lachit's tactical innovations.

I reported these capabilities to Ram Singh, of course, but carefully minimized their significance. "The Ahom possess adequate firearms," I told him, "but lack the professional training and organizational discipline of imperial forces. Their noble warriors are competent but not exceptional by European standards."

This was a lie. The Hiloidari Konwars were exceptional by any standard, and I knew they would be devastating against Mughal forces fighting under the conditions Lachit was preparing.

Meanwhile, I reported to Lachit that my assessments of his forces were being dismissed as unthreatening by Mughal command. "Ram Singh believes your warriors lack the discipline to stand against professional imperial troops," I told him during one of our meetings. "He is planning tactics based on that assumption."

"Excellent," Lachit replied with cold satisfaction. "Overconfidence will make them predictable."

The most dangerous information I provided concerned our naval commander, Admiral Munnawar Khan. I gave Lachit complete intelligence on the old warrior's tactical preferences, his positioning habits during battle, and critically, the fact that he personally commanded from the flagship's poop deck where he remained visible to coordinate fleet maneuvers.

"If Munnawar Khan falls," I explained during one meeting, "your fleet command structure will collapse. He is the only admiral with sufficient experience to coordinate naval operations of this complexity. The other captains are competent individually but have never operated as a coordinated fleet without his direct command."

"Then Munnawar Khan becomes a priority target," Lachit said simply.

I had just signed the old admiral's death warrant. I felt a brief flicker of something—not quite guilt, perhaps just the recognition that I was condemning a man I respected. But the gold mohurs buried in Dhaka weighed heavier than sentiment.

### The Sabotage

As the campaign progressed toward its climax, I began actively sabotaging Mughal operations in ways that could not be traced to deliberate action.

Artillery positions I recommended turned out to have inadequate fields of fire due to "unforeseen" terrain features. Supply routes I surveyed proved more difficult than anticipated, creating logistics delays that disrupted Ram Singh's operational timeline. Intelligence assessments I provided consistently underestimated Ahom capabilities while overestimating the ease of river operations.

None of these could be definitively identified as sabotage. I simply appeared to be a military advisor who lacked complete understanding of local conditions—a reasonable conclusion for a Portuguese firangi serving in Assam for the first time.

The most effective sabotage was more subtle: shaping Ram Singh's strategic thinking toward options that played into Lachit's hands. I emphasized the vulnerability of Ahom positions around Guwahati, suggesting that a coordinated land and naval assault would quickly overwhelm their defenses. I minimized the tactical advantages they could gain from their superior knowledge of local waterways.

In essence, I made our inevitable defeat appear to be our best path to victory.

"The Ahom fleet cannot stand against our warships in open-water engagement," I assured Ram Singh during our final strategic planning session before the battle. "Their boats are too small and lack adequate armor. If we force them to fight on the river rather than in narrow channels, our superior firepower will be decisive."

Ram Singh, who was no fool, questioned this assessment. "Your reports suggest they are better adapted to river fighting than our forces. Why would they accept open-water battle?"

"They will have no choice," I explained with confidence I did not feel. "Once we establish control of the main channel at Saraighat, they cannot supply Guwahati without engaging our fleet directly. Lachit will be forced to fight the battle we want rather than the battle he wants."

This was my most effective deception. Lachit had no intention of accepting open-water battle. He planned to use the apparent vulnerability of his positions to draw our fleet into the narrow confines of Saraighat where his small-boat tactics would prove most effective. I was helping Ram Singh walk into a trap while convincing him he was forcing Lachit into an advantageous engagement.

The Mughal commander accepted my analysis because it aligned with his understanding of naval warfare. Heavy ships with superior firepower should dominate lighter vessels in open water. This principle had held true across centuries of naval combat.

It would prove worthless on the Brahmaputra.

### The Night Before

The evening before the battle of Saraighat, I met with Ramcharan for the final time. We stood in the shadow of our supply tents while Mughal soldiers prepared weapons and said prayers to their various gods.

"Tomorrow," I said quietly, passing him my final intelligence report wrapped in oilcloth. "Ram Singh will commit the fleet to a direct assault on the Ahom positions at dawn. Munnawar Khan will command from the flagship, positioned in the center of our line to coordinate fleet maneuvers. The admiral believes the narrow width of the river will work to our advantage by concentrating our firepower."

"Lachit will be pleased," Ramcharan said, tucking the package into his tunic. "Your final payment is ready. Where do you want it delivered?"

"The house in Dhaka," I replied. "Same location as before. I will collect it after the campaign concludes."

"You are certain you will survive tomorrow?" He asked it casually, but there was genuine curiosity in his voice. "You will be on the Mughal ships when they are destroyed."

"I am very good at surviving," I assured him. "I did not betray one empire only to die serving another."

He nodded and disappeared into the darkness, carrying intelligence that would seal our fate.

I returned to my tent and spent the night checking my pistols, sharpening my cutlass, and reviewing my escape plan. When the Mughal fleet collapsed—and it would collapse—I needed to appear sufficiently engaged in the fighting to avoid suspicion while actually positioning myself to survive the disaster I had orchestrated.

It required a delicate balance, but I had played similar roles before. Survival was a skill like any other, and I had been practicing it for twenty years.

### The Battle of Saraighat

Dawn broke clear on that February morning in 1671, the Brahmaputra reflecting golden light that seemed to mock the blood it would soon carry. I stood on the deck of our war galley as the Mughal fleet formed line of battle, 40 warships carrying the professional soldiers who believed they were about to crush another regional kingdom into submission.

Admiral Munnawar Khan commanded from the flagship's poop deck, his jeweled sword raised high as he shouted orders. The old lion was magnificent—sixty years of naval combat had taught him to project confidence in the chaos before battle. Our ships moved into position with disciplined precision, artillery crews loading their cannons with practiced efficiency.

On the opposite shore, the Ahom positions appeared vulnerable, exactly as I had suggested they would be. Their smaller boats seemed to hover uncertainly behind reed-covered banks, outnumbered and outgunned by our superior fleet.

It was a perfect trap, and Ram Singh was sailing directly into it.

The signal flags dropped, and our fleet surged forward. Artillery boomed as we opened fire on the Ahom positions, bronze cannons sending iron shot screaming across the water. Smoke billowed across the river, and for a moment, it seemed as if the battle would unfold exactly as Ram Singh had planned.

Then the Ahom boats emerged from channels that did not appear on our charts.

They came from everywhere at once—reed banks that dissolved into flotillas of small, swift vessels; side channels we had dismissed as too shallow for military use; positions hidden behind the river's islands and sandbars. Dozens of boats, then hundreds, swarming toward our line with coordinated precision that spoke of months of intensive training.

"*Madre de Deus!*" I screamed as the first Ahom boats crashed into our hull. Their tactics were suicidal—ramming directly into larger vessels, crews leaping aboard before our gunners could depress their cannons to fire at close range. But the tactics worked because they had been designed specifically to neutralize our firepower advantage.

Curved swords flashed in the morning sun. The Ahom warrior who landed beside me opened the throat of our gunner with a single stroke, his blade moving with practiced efficiency. Blood sprayed across the bronze cannon, and the deck became slippery with gore.

I raised my pistol and fired into the smoke, the shot going deliberately wide. Then I stumbled backward as if driven by fear, putting distance between myself and the fighting while maintaining the appearance of engagement. Other Portuguese gunners fought desperately around their artillery pieces, but without infantry support, they were being overwhelmed by Ahom boarding parties.

Our larger vessels, which should have been our advantage, became death traps. The Ahom boats were too small, too quick, too numerous. They darted between our warships, appearing from reed channels we had not even known existed. Their bamboo pikes punched through armor, and their poisoned arrows found every gap in our defenses.

The acrid smoke of gunpowder mixed with the copper stench of blood and the sweet-sick smell of fear-sweat. Men screamed in Portuguese, Hindi, Rajasthani, and a dozen other languages as they died far from home, serving an emperor they had never met.

And then I saw it happen.

Admiral Munnawar Khan stood on the flagship's poop deck, his jeweled sword still raised as he shouted orders through the chaos. The old warrior was trying to maintain formation discipline, to coordinate fleet maneuvers that would allow our superior firepower to turn the tide.

He never had a chance. Lachit's intelligence on the admiral's command position had been used to deadly effect.

The musket ball caught him in the spine as he turned to direct the rear guard. The shot came from an Ahom marksman positioned on one of those swift boats that seemed to be retreating but were actually maneuvering into optimal firing positions. Blood foamed from Munnawar Khan's mouth as he tried to speak, his final words lost in the screaming wind and crack of splintering wood.

"The Admiral is down!" The cry spread through our fleet like plague. I watched seasoned Mughal sailors—men who had fought from Bengal to the Deccan—stare at their commander's body with the shocked faces of children who had just learned that even giants can die.

It was exactly as I had predicted to Lachit. Without Munnawar Khan's steady voice cutting through the battle noise, our fleet's coordination dissolved into chaos. Ship captains who had been following coordinated tactics suddenly found themselves fighting isolated battles, each vessel surrounded by swarms of Ahom attackers whose knowledge of every current and sandbar turned the Brahmaputra into their ally.

I had killed him as surely as if I had fired the shot myself. The intelligence I provided had made his death not just possible but inevitable.

The decisive factor was the superior knowledge of local conditions that allowed Ahom forces to exploit currents, depths, and seasonal variations that Mughal commanders had not anticipated. Vessels that appeared to be retreating were actually drawing enemy ships into positions where they could be attacked from multiple directions by boats emerging from channels that did not appear on Mughal charts.

Every tactical advantage Lachit employed came directly from intelligence I had provided or tactical weaknesses I had helped him understand. The battle was not just a Mughal defeat—it was a perfectly orchestrated destruction made possible by eight months of systematic betrayal.

Our bronze cannons, which should have swept the river clear of enemy boats, proved nearly useless. The recoil and stability problems I had warned Lachit about became critical factors as our gun crews struggled to track fast-moving targets from pitching decks. The superior firepower we relied upon never materialized because we could not bring it to bear effectively against enemies who refused to fight the kind of battle our tactics were designed for.

I fought just enough to maintain appearances—firing my pistols at distant targets, swinging my cutlass at Ahom warriors who came too close, shouting commands in Portuguese that no one could hear over the screaming chaos. But mostly, I positioned myself to survive.

When our galley's mainmast came crashing down, I used the confusion to slip over the side, clinging to debris while the battle raged above me. I floated downstream with the current, past burning ships and drowning men, until I could drag myself onto a muddy bank far from the killing zone.

From that relatively safe position, I watched the complete destruction of the Mughal fleet.

### The Aftermath of Treachery

The Mughal defeat at Saraighat was so complete that Ram Singh I was forced to withdraw his entire expedition from Assam, ending the most serious attempt to conquer the Ahom kingdom during Aurangzeb's reign. The retreat that followed was pursued by Ahom forces to the Manas River, reestablishing the traditional western boundary of the kingdom while capturing substantial quantities of equipment and supplies.

I rejoined the remnants of our forces three days after the battle, my uniform torn and bloodstained, my story one of narrow survival and heroic resistance against overwhelming odds. No one questioned my account. There were too many dead and too few survivors for detailed investigations.

Ram Singh himself was devastated by the defeat, though he remained professionally focused on extracting his forces with minimal additional casualties. I watched him during the retreat, seeing the weight of failure in his shoulders, the recognition that he had been comprehensively out-generaled by an opponent he had underestimated.

If he suspected treachery, he gave no sign. The defeat could be explained by the tactical advantages of local knowledge, the effectiveness of Ahom naval innovations, and the death of Admiral Munnawar Khan at a critical moment. These were reasonable military explanations that did not require conspiratorial thinking.

I provided my final reports as his Portuguese military advisor, carefully analyzing the Ahom tactics we had faced. My assessments were professionally competent, noting the superior small-boat coordination, the effective use of local geographic knowledge, and the devastating impact of losing our naval commander at the crucial moment.

"We were defeated by superior adaptation to local conditions," I concluded in my written report. "The Ahom have developed tactical innovations specifically designed to counter Mughal advantages in conventional warfare. Future campaigns in this region will require fundamentally different approaches to naval operations."

It was all true, though I carefully omitted my role in making those Ahom innovations devastatingly effective.

### The Golden Reward

Two weeks after the withdrawal from Assam, I received permission to return to Portuguese territories, my contract with the Mughal forces concluded. Ram Singh even provided a modest payment for my services, apparently satisfied that I had performed my duties competently despite the campaign's failure.

I collected that payment with appropriate gratitude, then made my way to Dhaka where a much larger sum waited beneath the floorboards of a rented house.

The chest was exactly where it should be, hidden under bricks in the foundation. I opened it alone in the darkness, and the gold gleamed in my lamplight. Five times the initial payment, as promised. Enough wealth to purchase land, to establish myself as a gentleman rather than a mercenary, to live comfortably for the rest of my days.

I counted it twice, feeling the weight of each mohur. Men had died for this gold—good men, brave men, men who had trusted me. Admiral Munnawar Khan, whose death I had orchestrated. Common soldiers who drowned in the Brahmaputra because I helped Lachit design the tactics that killed them.

The gold remained gold regardless.

Empires rise and empires fall. The Mughal Empire would continue with or without Assam. Aurangzeb would find other kingdoms to conquer, other armies to destroy. My betrayal changed nothing in the larger pattern.

But it changed everything for me. I was wealthy now, secure, no longer dependent on the whims of generals and the fortunes of war.

I buried the gold again—it was too much to travel with safely—and made arrangements to return in six months after the immediate aftermath of the campaign had faded from memory. Then I continued my journey to Portuguese territories, just another military advisor whose services were no longer required.

### The River Warrior's Death

I learned of Lachit Borphukan's death in April 1672, only months after his greatest victory. The news reached me in Goa, where I had established myself in modest comfort while waiting to retrieve my gold.

The consumption that had ravaged him throughout the campaign had finally claimed his life. He died knowing he had saved his kingdom, having proven that indigenous military innovations could defeat the most powerful empire in Asia.

I poured wine and drank to his memory. Not because I admired him—though I did—but because he had paid me fairly for services rendered. In a world of broken promises and betrayed contracts, that counted for something.

The innovations Lachit developed continued to protect the Ahom kingdom against subsequent Mughal attempts at conquest. His riverine warfare techniques influenced naval thinking throughout the region. The Ahom kingdom survived seventeen major Mughal invasion attempts over several decades, maintaining its independence through application of the principles he had pioneered.

I played no role in any of those later campaigns. I had earned my gold and had no interest in risking my newfound security in further military adventures. Let other mercenaries seek their fortunes in Assam's rivers. I had mine.

### The Moral Accounting

Twenty years have passed since the Battle of Saraighat. I write these words in 1691 from my estate in Portugal, purchased with gold earned through betrayal. I am old now, comfortable, respected as a gentleman who served in the East Indies.

No one knows what I did. The secret died with Lachit, with Ramcharan, with the network of Ahom agents who facilitated my treachery. Ram Singh never suspected. The Mughal Empire never investigated.

So why write this confession? Because history records brilliant generals and innovative tactics while ignoring simpler truths: that wars are won and lost not just through genius but through the common venality of men who can be bought.

Lachit Borphukan was a military genius—let there be no doubt of that. His innovations in riverine warfare were unprecedented. His understanding of geographic advantages was sophisticated. His organizational abilities and tactical planning were exceptional.

But he also won because I told him exactly what his enemies were planning, exactly where they were vulnerable, exactly how to kill them most efficiently. Even genius requires intelligence.

The Ahom kingdom's survival was not inevitable. It was purchased with gold, facilitated by betrayal, secured through systematic exploitation of intelligence that should never have been available. I was one factor among many, but not insignificant.

Does that diminish Lachit's achievement? I do not think so. Great commanders throughout history have exploited intelligence advantages when available. Caesar had his spies, Alexander his informants. The ability to recognize the value of intelligence and use it effectively is itself genius.

Lachit understood that defeating the Mughal Empire required more than battlefield tactics. It required systematic collection and analysis of information that would allow him to see his enemies more clearly than they saw themselves. He built the intelligence network, recruited the agents, paid the gold that made his victories possible.

I was simply one tool in that larger system, no different than his boats or cannons or fortifications. He used me effectively, as he used every other advantage at his disposal.

### The Legacy of Gold

The final expulsion of Mughal forces from Assam in 1682, during the Battle of Itakhuli, completed the process that Lachit had begun at Saraighat. The Ahom kingdom maintained its independence throughout the Mughal period, the only major Indian kingdom to completely repel all attempts at conquest.

That independence was built on Lachit's innovations, sustained by his strategic vision, and secured by his willingness to pay whatever price was necessary—including the purchase of Portuguese mercenaries who could be turned against their employers.

I am part of that history, though my name will never appear in the chronicles. The gold I earned bought my estate, secured my family's future, and allowed me to live comfortably into old age. It was blood money, earned through betrayal and purchased with the lives of men who trusted me.

I do not apologize for it. Apologies require regret, and I regret only that I did not demand a higher price. The gold was generous but not excessive for the value I provided. Future traitors should negotiate better terms.

This is the truth that histories rarely record: that great victories often depend on small acts of venality, that moral certainty is a luxury of those who can afford it, and that gold remains gold regardless of whose blood purchased it.

Lachit Borphukan was the river warrior who saved Assam from Mughal conquest. That is historical fact and deserves to be remembered and celebrated. But he saved Assam partly by purchasing the services of men like me, who understood that loyalty is simply another commodity in the marketplace of war.

I provided good value for the price paid. The Mughal fleet burned, Ram Singh retreated, and the Ahom kingdom survived. Lachit died a hero, and I lived to enjoy my retirement.

In the end, we both got what we wanted. The difference is that history remembers him.

As it should.

*End of Chapter 3*

**Historical Note:** Lachit Borphukan's victory at the Battle of Saraighat (1671) represents one of the most significant defeats suffered by Mughal forces during Aurangzeb's reign and demonstrated the effectiveness of regionally adapted military innovations against imperial expansion. While João Ribeiro is fictional, the role of European military advisors in Indian warfare and the prevalence of mercenary betrayal and intelligence operations were historical realities that shaped many campaigns. The Ahom kingdom's sophisticated intelligence networks and their systematic collection of information about Mughal capabilities were documented features of their military system. Lachit's development of riverine warfare tactics and systematic exploitation of geographic advantages provided a template for successful resistance that influenced military thinking throughout India. The Ahom kingdom's unique achievement in completely repelling Mughal conquest attempts over seventeen invasions established it as the only major Indian kingdom to maintain complete independence throughout the Mughal period, preserving a distinctive cultural and political tradition that survived until the British colonial era.
