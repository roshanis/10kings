## BOOK DESCRIPTION (Back Cover Copy)

**A gripping historical thriller that reveals the untold stories of ten forgotten rulers who shaped the destiny of medieval India through blood, brilliance, and unimaginable brutality.**

From 1000 to 1287 CE, while Europe struggled through its Dark Ages, the Indian subcontinent witnessed the rise and fall of extraordinary kings whose names have been erased from popular history but whose impact shaped a civilization. *Blood and Thrones* resurrects these shadow emperors through the eyes of those who witnessed their triumphs and atrocities firsthand.

**Meet the forgotten titans:**
• **Marthanda Varma** - The naval genius who crushed the Dutch East India Company
• **Mihira Bhoja Pratihara** - The "Iron Wall" who held back Islamic expansion for fifty years
• **Govinda III Rashtrakuta** - The "Southern Napoleon" who conquered most of India in twenty years
• **Ghiyas ud din Balban** - The Turkish slave who created the world's most sophisticated surveillance state
• **Alauddin Khilji** - The economic revolutionary who stopped Mongol invasions through systematic terror

Told through the perspectives of enemy generals, foreign observers, and court survivors, each chapter reads like a political thriller—complete with palace intrigue, revolutionary military tactics, and the kind of graphic violence that defined medieval power struggles.

*For readers who loved Game of Thrones, Wolf Hall, and The Accursed Kings—but crave the authenticity of real history and the exotic setting of medieval India.*

**This is not your textbook history. This is the brutal truth about power.**
