## BOOK DESCRIPTION (Back Cover Copy)

**Commercial / Retail-Optimized Description (eBook & Amazon product page):**

Ten forgotten Indian kings. One brutal, breathtaking history you were never taught.

From 1000 to 1758 CE, India saw philosophers who commanded armies, slaves who built surveillance states, and naval geniuses who broke European empires. *Blood and Thrones* turns that lost history into a fast-paced narrative, told through the eyes of soldiers, spies, scholars, and traitors who had everything to lose.

Meet the rulers who weaponized faith, language, money, and elephants:
- Marthanda Varma, the Travancore king who shattered Dutch power at Colachel
- Alauddin Khilji, the economic strategist who stopped Mongol invasions by controlling grain, prices, and information
- Lachit Borphukan, the river warrior who turned the Brahmaputra into a weapon against the Mughals
- Bukka Raya I and the birth of Vijayanagara, forged from captivity and religious politics
- Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I, whose Tamil fleets turned the Indian Ocean into a Pandya lake
- Simhana II Yadava, the monarch who made Marathi the language of governance
- Ghiyas ud din Balban, the former slave who turned the Delhi Sultanate into a machine of fear and order
- Kapilendra Deva, the Gajapati emperor who fought three enemies at once and almost won
- Vidyadhara Chandela, the temple builder whose night attacks forced Mahmud of Ghazni to retreat
- Raja Bhoja Paramara, the philosopher-king whose books and battles reshaped Indian statecraft

If you love the political games of *Game of Thrones* but want the stakes and strangeness of real history, this is where the dragons disappear but the brutality is all true.

**Literary / Jacket-Style Description (Paperback & Press):**

In the chronicles of empire, certain names are endlessly repeated. These pages belong to the ones that vanished.

Across nearly eight centuries, from the mountain forts of central India to the storm-torn coasts of Travancore, ten rulers wrestle with the same questions: how far power can go, what a king owes to his people, and what history chooses to remember. A scholar-king composes treatises between campaigns. A former slave builds an intelligence state that outlives him. A river general turns currents and fog into armor. A quiet reformer decides that language, not steel, will hold a kingdom together.

Each chapter is a self-contained chronicle, told by those who stood closest to the fire: a Maratha veteran dragged before Marthanda Varma’s court, a Mongol convert riding under Alauddin Khilji, a Portuguese advisor watching Lachit Borphukan turn the Brahmaputra into a weapon, a Sanskrit scholar witnessing Simhana II’s language revolution, a Persian chronicler struggling to understand Raja Bhoja’s blend of philosophy and war.

Blending archival research with the momentum of a political thriller, *Blood and Thrones* offers a portrait of India not as a backdrop to foreign conquest, but as a laboratory of statecraft where forgotten kings shaped the modern world in ways they could never fully control.
