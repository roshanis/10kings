# Chapter 6: The Language Revolution
## Simhana II Yadava - The Linguistic Pioneer Who Elevated Marathi (1200-1247 CE)

### The Day Children Starved

The summer of 1204 burned across the Deccan plateau like divine punishment. For four months, not a drop of rain had fallen on the parched fields of Maharashtra, and the wells that had sustained villages for centuries ran dry as bone.

I was with King Simhana in the emergency council session when the village headman from Junnar staggered through the palace doors, his weathered face gray with desperation, his hands clutching a rolled document as if it were his last hope.

"*Mahārāja*," he gasped, thrusting the royal decree forward. "Forgive me, but the words... I cannot..."

His voice broke. His hands trembled around the Sanskrit document that was supposed to save his village.

Simhana's face darkened like storm clouds gathering. "You cannot read it."

"My village has no Sanskrit scholar, *Mahārāja*. The children are..." The headman's voice cracked completely. "They are dying. And I stand here holding words I cannot understand."

The silence in that hall was deafening. Here was a loyal subject, a man whose taxes had filled the royal treasury for decades, watching his people starve because an emergency food distribution order was written in a language only scholars could read.

I saw something shift in Simhana's eyes then, something cold and decisive and utterly unyielding.

He strode to the headman, took the Sanskrit decree from his hands, and in a voice that carried to every corner of the hall, spoke its contents in fluent Marathi:

"*Duṣkāḷāt piḍita lokāñcā jīva vācvāyācā āhe. Rājyācyā koṭhārātūna hazāra khaṇḍī dhānya vāṭāyācē.*" (The lives of people afflicted by famine must be saved. A thousand *khandis* of grain must be distributed from the royal granaries.)

The headman's face blazed with understanding. He fell to his knees, tears streaming. "*Dhanyawād, Mahārāja!* My people will live!"

But Simhana was no longer looking at the grateful headman. He turned to his court, to the Sanskrit-educated elites whose entire authority rested upon linguistic exclusion, with the expression of a man who had just decided to overturn the ancient order.

"My lords," he said softly, each word deliberate, "we have just watched children starve because their fathers could not read Sanskrit."

He paused, letting the weight of that truth settle upon us all.

"This ends today."

I remember the king citing Mukundaraja, the philosopher-poet whose Marathi verses on Vedantic truth were already passing from village to village. "If such divine truths can be expressed in our mother tongue," Simhana said, "then surely earthly governance can be conducted in the language the people actually speak."

As a Sanskrit scholar, I confess these words troubled me deeply. Yet I could not deny their logic. This was not mere prejudice against Sanskrit but a reasoned argument that common understanding might serve governance better than ancient authority.

### The Transformation Begins

Within three months of that famine council, I watched the king's decree ripple through the administration like a stone cast into still water. Every royal order, every court judgment, every tax assessment that had once been inscribed in Sanskrit now appeared in Marathi.

The resistance was immediate and fierce. My fellow scholars protested that this degraded the dignity of governance. The Brahmins warned that the gods themselves spoke Sanskrit, and to abandon it in official matters courted divine displeasure. Senior administrators complained that centuries of precedent were being swept aside.

But Simhana was unmoved. "Let the gods speak Sanskrit in temples," he told his council. "In courts and treasuries, we shall speak the language of the people we govern."

I confess I expected chaos. How could unlettered village headmen suddenly conduct legal proceedings? How could merchants untrained in classical learning draft binding contracts?

Yet what unfolded surprised even the king's supporters. Within a year, the courts that had once operated through layers of Sanskrit-educated intermediaries now heard cases directly from litigants who could speak for themselves. The merchant who had previously paid scribes to translate his petitions could now present his own case. The farmer who had never understood the tax assessment written in Sanskrit could now read precisely what he owed and why.

The efficiency gains were undeniable. Disputes that had languished for months while awaiting translation and interpretation were now resolved in weeks. Trade contracts, once mysteries to those who signed them, became comprehensible documents. Even military orders, which had sometimes been garbled in translation from Sanskrit to the soldiers' Marathi, now reached the ranks with clarity.

### The Flowering of Marathi Learning

But the change that surprised me most was not administrative but literary. I had believed, as did most of my scholarly brethren, that Sanskrit alone possessed the refinement necessary for serious literary and philosophical work. Marathi was a language for markets and households, not for poetry or sacred commentary.

How wrong I was.

The first Marathi poet to receive royal patronage was Mukundaraja, whose verses on Vedantic philosophy demonstrated that abstract spiritual concepts could be rendered in the vernacular without loss of subtlety or depth. I remember reading his work with grudging admiration, then genuine awe. The man was composing philosophy of remarkable sophistication, yet any educated person could understand him without years of Sanskrit study.

Then came the devotional poets, the *bhakti* singers who transformed religious experience from elite ritual into popular movement. Their verses spread through villages like monsoon rain, carrying spiritual teachings to people who had never set foot in a Sanskrit school.

I watched this flowering with mixed feelings. Part of me mourned the diminishment of Sanskrit's privileged position. But another part, the part that loved learning itself regardless of language, could not help but rejoice. Knowledge was spreading. Wisdom was reaching minds that had been locked out by linguistic barriers.

The king understood this better than most. He kept Sanskrit alive in his court, still employed scholars like myself, still funded traditional learning. But he also recognized that a language known only to elites could not serve the needs of a living, breathing kingdom. Marathi and Sanskrit, he insisted, could coexist. Each had its proper sphere.

More than once, unsigned Marathi verses circulated through the markets of Devagiri, sharp little dialogues in which a pompous Sanskrit scholar was out-argued by a village woman or a tax collector forced to explain himself to a farmer. The court officially ignored them. In private, I recognized the king's turns of phrase in certain barbs and metaphors. Whether anyone else did, I never asked.

### The Balance of Two Tongues

I came to see Simhana's vision most clearly in the bilingual inscriptions that appeared on temples and public buildings throughout the kingdom. Sanskrit above, proclaiming the eternal truths and invoking the blessings of the gods. Marathi below, explaining to common people what the inscription commemorated and what it meant for their lives.

This was not replacement but synthesis. Sanskrit retained its sacred dignity, its role in preserving ancient wisdom and connecting our kingdom to the broader civilizational currents of India. But Marathi claimed its rightful place as the language of living governance, the tongue through which king and subject could speak directly to one another.

I remember a conversation with a merchant from Gujarat who visited our court. He examined one of these bilingual inscriptions with great interest. "Your king," he said to me, "has found something remarkable. He has made governance accessible without abandoning tradition. He has elevated the common tongue without debasing the sacred one."

That observation, from an outsider unburdened by our internal debates, crystallized what Simhana had accomplished. He had proven that regional identity need not war against broader Indian unity, that practical innovation need not threaten spiritual continuity.

The prosperity that followed surprised those who had predicted chaos. Trade flourished when contracts could be understood by all parties. Tax collection improved when assessment documents were comprehensible. Even the temples, those bastions of Sanskrit learning, found their influence growing as religious teachings reached common people through Marathi devotional literature.

### A Kingdom United by Understanding

Yet I would be dishonest if I portrayed this transformation as purely benevolent. Simhana understood, as all effective rulers must, that language policy served political ends.

A subject who could read the king's decrees felt connected to royal authority in ways that transcended mere obedience to incomprehensible commands. When a farmer read his tax assessment in his own tongue and found it fair, he paid willingly rather than resentfully. When a soldier understood his orders clearly, he followed them with confidence rather than confusion.

This was governance through comprehension rather than through mystification. And it bound the people to their king more surely than force ever could.

I watched Simhana wield this understanding with remarkable skill. Other kingdoms, still conducting all official business in Sanskrit, found themselves plagued by miscommunication and popular resentment. Their subjects obeyed because they must, not because they understood or agreed. But in Maharashtra, a new relationship emerged between ruler and ruled, built on the foundation of shared language.

The diplomatic advantages were equally clear. When envoys from other courts visited, they encountered a kingdom where royal authority ran deep into the common population, where the king's word reached even remote villages without distortion or delay. This was power of a different sort than mere military might, though no less formidable for that.

### The Education of a New Generation

Perhaps the most profound change I witnessed was in education itself. When I was young, learning meant Sanskrit first, last, and always. A student spent years mastering grammar, memorizing verses, absorbing the weight of tradition before he could even begin to engage with practical knowledge.

But the schools that emerged under Simhana's patronage took a different path. Young students learned to read and write Marathi first, gaining basic literacy in months rather than years. Only then did they advance to Sanskrit if they wished to pursue traditional scholarship.

I served briefly as an instructor in one such school and watched this approach work with my own eyes. Boys who would have given up in frustration after months of Sanskrit declensions now learned eagerly, their mother tongue unlocking the world of letters. Some went on to Sanskrit later, bringing to it a foundation of literacy that made the learning easier. Others stopped with Marathi, possessing enough learning to function as clerks, merchants, or administrators.

This, I came to understand, was not the abandonment of traditional learning but its expansion. Sanskrit scholarship continued, but it no longer served as a barrier that kept most people from any learning at all. Knowledge became something accessible to talent rather than merely to those whose families could afford years of expensive education.

The kingdom benefited from this opening of opportunity. Bright young men from modest backgrounds could now aspire to positions that had once been reserved for Sanskrit-educated elites. The administration filled with capable officials who understood both common needs and governance requirements because they came from those same common origins.

### The Economic Impact

Trade, law, and administration changed as quickly as the language on our decrees. I watched merchants, scribes, and village headmen discover that once they could read the rules in Marathi, wealth, justice, and royal orders all moved with a new, unsettling efficiency.

By the time Simhana died in 1247, Marathi had become the tongue in which ordinary people met their king. Sanskrit scholarship endured, but it now shared space with a vernacular that carried both grain orders and sacred verse. I left Devagiri knowing I had witnessed not just a policy but the birth of a different way of being ruled.

### The Scholar's Discovery

As I gathered my scrolls and prepared to leave the Yadava court for my next appointment in the north, I discovered something that chilled my scholarly blood. Hidden in the depths of the royal archives, wrapped in silk and sealed with wax that bore no royal mark, I found a document that would haunt me for the rest of my days.

It was written entirely in Marathi, not surprising, given Simhana's linguistic revolution. But the content was treasonous beyond imagination.

The document was a manual. A systematic guide to overthrowing Sanskrit-based authority in every kingdom across India. It contained detailed instructions for disrupting traditional Brahmin networks, techniques for turning local populations against Sanskrit-educated administrators, and most damning of all, a list of sympathetic scholars in courts from Kashmir to Kerala who were prepared to implement similar linguistic revolutions in their own kingdoms.

"You found it," came a voice from behind me.

I spun around to find Simhana himself, his eyes glittering with dangerous satisfaction. "Your Majesty, I was simply organizing the archives..."

"You were snooping, as scholars do." His smile was coldly amused. "Tell me, *pandit*, what do you think of my little project?"

My hands trembled as I held the seditious document. "This is... this could destroy the entire structure of traditional Indian governance."

"Precisely." He moved closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Every kingdom in India depends on a Sanskrit-educated elite that common people cannot understand or challenge. But what happens when those common people suddenly discover they can govern themselves in their own languages?"

The implications crashed over me like a tsunami. Not just linguistic change, but social revolution. Not just cultural evolution, but the systematic destruction of brahminical authority across the subcontinent.

"You're not just changing Maharashtra," I whispered. "You're planning to change all of India."

"I am planning to liberate India," he corrected. "From the tyranny of incomprehensible governance, from the chains of linguistic exclusion, from the entire system that keeps millions of people subject to the whims of men they cannot understand."

As I left the palace carrying knowledge that could topple dynasties, I understood at last what Simhana had truly created. This was no mere administrative reform but the opening move in a struggle over who had the right to read the language of power.

Hidden in my traveling pack, wrapped carefully in cloth, was a copy of that revolutionary manual. Somewhere beyond the borders of Maharashtra, other scholars would read it, argue over it, and decide whether they dared to make their own people literate in the workings of rule.

The linguistic revolution had begun. And I was its unwilling messenger.

*End of Chapter 6*

**Historical Note:** Simhana II Yadava's systematic elevation of Marathi to official status (1200-1247 CE) marked a crucial turning point in Indian linguistic and cultural development, establishing the first major precedent for regional language assertion in medieval India. His policies demonstrated that vernacular languages could serve the purposes of governance and literature while preserving rather than erasing traditional Sanskrit learning. The Yadava dynasty's innovations influenced Maharashtra's distinctive identity and provided templates for linguistic policies later adopted in other regions. The secret pan-Indian "manual" for overthrowing Sanskrit-based authority and its dissemination, as depicted in this chapter, are fictional devices used to dramatize real tensions around language, power, and Brahmin dominance.

*[Editor's Note: While Vaidyanatha Shastri is a fictional character, Sanskrit scholars were indeed employed in Yadava courts during the linguistic transition. The systematic elevation of Marathi in official documents represents one of the earliest and most successful examples of regional language assertion in medieval India, establishing patterns that would influence cultural development for centuries.]*
